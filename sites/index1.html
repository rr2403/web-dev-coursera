    <h3>Jake Peralta</h3>

    <p class="red">Andy Samberg as Detective Jacob "Jake" Peralta, a talented but childish detective. Peralta shows "class clown" traits, constantly pulling pranks and making immature jokes at the expense of his colleagues, particularly his partner, Amy Santiago. He is fun-loving and sarcastic but is often motivated by his emotions more than his colleagues. Despite his goofy traits, Peralta is extremely smart, perceptive and quick thinking, and as such has the best arrest rate in the precinct. In the pilot, Terry Jeffords explains to Captain Holt that Peralta is his best detective, that he likes putting away bad guys, and that he loves puzzles, although "the only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up." As of season seven, he is 38 years old and has been a detective with the 9-9 since 2005.</p>

    <h3>Amy Santiago</h3>

    <p>Melissa Fumero portrays Sergeant (previously Detective) Amy Santiago, Jake's uptight, by-the-book, rule-following Cuban-American partner, and later wife.[8] A self-acknowledged type A personality and neurotic overachiever, she continually tried to ingratiate herself with Captain Holt, and any authority figure in arm's reach of her. In the pilot, Terry cites Amy's competitiveness to Holt as a result of her having seven brothers. Amy is a stickler for department protocol and is frequently exasperated by Jake's childishness, as well as the ease with which he succeeds as a detective. She is initially seen as Holt's teacher's pet, but over time is shown to command<nbsp> respect from others</nbsp></p>

  <section id="section3">

    <h3>Captain Raymond Holt</h3>

    <p>Andre Braugher portrays Captain Raymond Jacob Holt, the 99th Precinct's strict Commanding Officer. Holt is known for his cold, calm and robotic manner of speaking, overly formal demeanor and lack of outwardly visible emotion, although his non-work friends frequently refer to him having a much more fun persona that is very rarely seen by either the Nine-Nine members or the viewer. He has sophisticated and cultured interests, enjoying classical music, opera and attending dinner parties with his husband's academic friends, amongst other things. The Nine-Nine is Holt's first command despite many years of outstanding service, and he attributes the delay to prejudice against both his race and homosexuality. He came out in 1987 and until recently led a group that supported LGBT African-American NYPD members, which he himself created.[8] He was a homicide detective in the 1980s, and spent twelve years in the Community Affairs Bureau immediately prior to commanding the Nine-Nine.</p>

    <h3>Terry</h3>

    <p id="t">ews portrays Lieutenant (previously Sergeant) Terrence "Terry" Vincent Jeffords, the supervisor of the 9-9's Detective Squad. An avid bodybuilder who stands at more than six feet tall, with a linebacker's build, Terry's intimidating size and appearance is contrasted by his gentle giant persona, being very caring and parental in nature. Jeffords is devoted to his wife and three young daughters Cagney, Lacey (named after the 1980s TV series), and Ava. He fears the danger of police work because of the possibility that he could leave his children fatherless. Following a panic attack prior to the show's beginning, Terry was removed from field work, but he has since cautiously returned. He is high-strung, prone to nervous excitement, loves yogurt, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He is an effective and caring leader to the detective squad, often having to play the mature adult in order to keep them in line.</p>

    <h3>Charles Boyle</h3>

    <p>Joe Lo Truglio portrays Detective Charles Boyle, a nervous and clumsy but honest and hard-working detective.[8] He is Jake's best friend, and almost completely idolizes him. He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic foodie, maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers.</p>
